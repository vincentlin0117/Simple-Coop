Congratulation! Your team of developers have been chosen to develop a web application to
interface with the Smart Chicken Coop offered by the SwollenHippo company.
The Smart Chicken Coop is a Internet of Things (IoT) connected device with a target market of
busy, lifestyle conscience consumers. These consumers are often young professionals that are
building their career but would like an opportunity to test the waters in the back-to-the-land
movement. Of note, these consumers are likely to shop at retail locations including Tractor
Supply, WholeFoods, and Trader Joe’s.
This application will be a single-page application written in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. You
are expected to use Bootstrap to help develop a consistent UI across devices (responsive) and
ensure an attractive appearance. In addition to the use of Bootstrap, you will be utilizing the
jQuery library and other components such as SweetAlerts2 and ChartJS.
For this assignment you are expected to begin building your application with three
experiences.
1. The first experience should be a login form. The login form is expected to:
    1. Allow a user to enter their username (email) and password.
    2. Contain an element/mechanism that will allow the user to view a Registration form
    3. Contain an element to ‘login’ to the system.
        1. For this assignment, the login will simply hide the login form and display a new
        blank dashboard experience.
2. The second experience should be a registration form. The registration form is expected to:
    1. Allow a user to enter in the appropriate information to create a new account including
        1. Email
        2. Password
        3. First Name
        4. Last Name
        5. Street Address 1
        6. Street Address 2
        7. City
        8. State
        9. ZIP
        10. Email
        11. Phone
        12. Coop Registration ID
    2. Contain an element/mechanism that will allow the user to cancel the registration
    process and return to the Login experience
    3. Contain an element/mechanism to create an account.
    4. For this assignment, the create account will simple hide the registration form experience
    and display a new blank dashboard experience

3. A blank dashboard experience. The blank dashboard experience is expected to:
    1. Only show a blank screen without any elements or controls
